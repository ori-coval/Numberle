# Numberle
A wordle-like game but with numbers

  ## current features:
* The numbrele game itself with the ability to play it yourself in the terminal
* Easy to play using a machine
* An auto solving algorithm
  ### current solving times
| random number length | avg amount of guesses | sample size |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 5 | 5.72384 | 100000 |
| 10 | 7.26195 | 100000 |
| 100 | 14.2957 | 100000 |
| 1000 | 18.308 | 1000 |
| 10000 | 21.68 | 100 |
| 100000 | 25.2 | 10 |
| 250000 | 26.2 | 5 |
  
* A time and number of guesses solving tester with basic graphing capability

## Work in progress:
* Better solving algorithm
* Ability to add 2 line graphs in the same windows


## If I have power
* Multi-threading for solving test
* Better graphing capabilities
* A GUI

## If I decide I hate myself
* Multi-threading solving
* Running it on a GPU
* Multi-threading on GPU
